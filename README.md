[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmwill/Polynomial.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hmwill/Polynomial.jl)

A starter pckage to do commutative algebra with Julia. Specifically, this package conatins the following:

- User-definable polynomial rings
- Polynomials (of course) incl. common ring operators
- Common algorithms, such as lcm, gdc
- Gr√∂bner bases and supporting algorithms
- Characteristic sets and Wu-Ritt elimination (and variations) for equation solving
